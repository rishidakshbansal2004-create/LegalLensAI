# 🏛️ LegalLens AI. -V1
### RAG-Powered Indian Legal Assistant

> *Empowering everyday Indians with legal knowledge — in plain language, with cited sources.*


---

## 📖 About

Most Indians don't have access to a lawyer for everyday legal questions — whether it's a builder delaying possession, an online fraud, or filing an RTI. **LegalLens AI** bridges that gap.

Built on a **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** pipeline, LegalLens AI retrieves relevant sections directly from official Indian law PDFs and grounds every answer in the actual legal text — no hallucinations, no guessing. Every response includes source citations showing exactly which section and which act the answer came from.

**Supports English, Hindi, and Hinglish queries** — automatically responds in the language of the query.

## ✨ Features

- **RAG Pipeline** — Retrieves relevant legal chunks before generating any answer
- **Query Classification** — Intelligently routes STANDALONE vs FOLLOWUP queries
- **Source Citations** — Every answer cites exact law and page number
- **Answer Verification** — LLM-as-judge checks if answer is grounded in retrieved chunks (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- **Actionable Steps** — Tells users what they can actually do, not just what the law says
- **Hinglish Support** — Works with Hindi, English, and mixed queries
- **Chat History** — Maintains conversation context across follow-up questions
- **Graceful Fallback** — Says "I couldn't find this" instead of hallucinating
- **Retry Logic** — Handles API rate limits automatically

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Gemini API key (free at [aistudio.google.com](https://aistudio.google.com))

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rishidakshbansal2004-create/LegalLensAI.git
cd LegalLensAI
```

### 2. Create virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### 5. Download legal documents
Download the following official PDFs and place them in the `documents/` folder:

| File | Source |
|---|---|
| `rera_2016.pdf` | [indiacode.nic.in](https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/2214/1/A2016-16.pdf) |
| `consumer_protection_act_2019.pdf` | [indiacode.nic.in](https://indiacode.nic.in) |
| `rti_act_2005.pdf` | [indiacode.nic.in](https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1975/3/right_to_information_act.pdf) |
| `it_act_2000.pdf` | [indiacode.nic.in](https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/13116/1/it_act_2000_updated.pdf) |
| `motor_vehicles_act_1988.pdf` | [indiacode.nic.in](https://indiacode.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/1798/1/A1988-59.pdf) |

### 6. Build the vector database
```bash
python ingest.py
```
This runs once and builds ChromaDB with 1,437 chunks from all 5 acts. Takes 2-3 minutes on first run (downloads embedding model).

### 7. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.
